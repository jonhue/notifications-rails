# Changelog

Notifications Rails follows Semantic Versioning 2.0 as defined at http://semver.org.

### Breaking Changes

* Change Pusher API to not push immediately when initialized. **Important**: If you have any custom
  pushers, you need to add a `call` method to it and *move* any code out of `initialize` (except
  code that is just doing initialization) and into the `call` method. [#49] (#55)

* Groups should now be defined using callables like `-> { where(subscriber: true) }`. [#44] (#84)

### Deprecated

* None
